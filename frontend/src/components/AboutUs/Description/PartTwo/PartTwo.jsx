        The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate
        existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the
        same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their
        pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new
        common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive
        translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform
        grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages
        coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and
        regular.
